# Module-5-Challenge-Password-Generator

# Password Generator

## Description

I was tasked with creating a Password Generator which when the button is clicked presents a series of Prompts for the user to determine password criteria. These criteria include: Length (at least 8 chars), character types - lowercase, uppercase, numeric or special as well as validation for each type of input and ensuring at least one is chosen.

I was provided with 4 arrays to represent the different character types, as well as the basic framework for the structure of the code.

Once the user has advised the length and which character types to include, the password needs to be generated and displayed onto the page using the included document queryselector code.

## Usage

The Challenge is comprised of 3 files. I revised the structure to bring it inline with what I have learned, I included the CSS and JS in the assets folder. The HTML provides an interface for the user to see the result of the application.

The Console is accessed through the browser and contains the output of the JavaScript I wrote.

Closer look at the Console reveals the output.
